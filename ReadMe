mbed run the RPC loop to get input string commands from PC/Python, and it will in turn call custom RPC functions.
PC/Python use RPC over serial to send a command to call accelerator capture mode on mbed.
In this accelerator capture function, mbed will record a set of accelerator data values.
classify the saved accelerator data values with the gesture classification TF Lite model you trained in mbed lab 8.
mbed will publish the classified gesture as an event through WiFi/MQTT to a broker and show the gesture ID on uLCD.
extract features determines whether the anle is over threshold angle(30) and record it.
After the PC/Python gets 10 gesture events, from the broker, it sends a command to mbed to stop the accelerator capture mode.
plot the The classified gesture events and The extracted features in two sub figures aligned with the event sequence order in PC/Python.
